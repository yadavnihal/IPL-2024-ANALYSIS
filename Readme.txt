Step 4: Creating Measures
Developing measures such as batting average, strike rate, and other relevant metrics to enhance the analysis.
Step 5: Data Visualization
Creating raw data visualization pages for different player roles:
Openers
Middle-order batsmen
Lower-order anchors
All-rounders
Bowlers
Step 6: Enhancing the Analysis
Finalizing the analysis by refining the visualizations and performing additional enhancements for better insights.
Conclusion
